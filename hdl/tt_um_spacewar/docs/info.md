## How it works

It's just the controller example from VGA playground, but you can also move a little square on the screen. It would have been an entire game if I hadn't taken a break when the Efabless shutdown was announced.

## How to test

Operating the controller D-Pad will move the square around the screen.

## External hardware

It accepts the VGA PMOD, Audio PMOD, and SNES PMOD. The pinout is configured for the demoscene competition.
