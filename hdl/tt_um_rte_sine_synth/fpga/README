Files to make the TinyTapeout project compatible with a
Digilent Arty A7-35T FPGA development board
--------------------------------------------------------
Note that the Arty A7 runs at 100MHz while the TinyTapeout
project is expected to top out at 50MHz.  This is taken
care of by putting the project inside a wrapper that has
code to divide the clock by a factor of two.

Otherwise, the implementation maps to the Arty
essentially unchanged, only requiring a configuration
file to map the I/O to Arty pins.

The 3 PMOD ports (8 x 3 or 24 signals) on the TinyTapeout
development board map to the PMODs on the Arty as follows:

	JA = input
	JB = bidirectional
	JC = output

For this sinusoid synth project, The TinyTapeout audio
module should connect to JB.

The output appears in 8-bit binary on JC, where it can
be monitored by a Digilent Analog Discovery 2 logic
analyzer.

Because there is no 8-button module, the input PMOD
signals are instead mapped to the switches and buttons,
in order SW3->SW0 then BTN3->BTN0.

The reset signal for the project is attached to the
"Reset" pin on the Arty.  Note that the Arty "Reset"
is a pull-up to power that is grounded by a button
press, so it is sense inverted and exactly matches
the "rst_n" input of the TinyTapeout project without
modification.

The Arty A7 provides a 100MHz clock which is mapped to
"clk" on the wrapper, then divided by 2 and passed to
the TinyTapeout project.

See "arty_a7_35T.xdc" for the pin mapping.
--------------------------------------------------------

When running vivado, choose "tt_um_rte_sine_synth_wrapper.v"
as the top level, and "arty_a7_35T.xdc" as the pin
config file.  The wrapper includes the verilog files it
uses, so there is no need to select any other source
files or directories.  The application should synthesize
and program without issue.  I setup up the project in
vivado with a subdirectory of fpga/ called "tt_sine_synth/",
although the location of the vivado project is arbitrary
(fpga/tt_sine_synth was added to .gitignore so that it
does not get pushed to the repository).
