## About CEG Fabless
CEG Fabless is a Student-Faculty-Alumni Integrated Circuits design initiative at the Department of ECE, College of Engineering Guindy(CEG). Our mission is to enable students to explore, experiment and build ASICs to solve real world problems through collaborative mentorship from academia and industry experts.

### TinyTapeout Participation
This project is part of the TinyTapeout 10 (TT10) shuttle program, with Team ID: CF-2024-TT10-06.

## Research References
This project builds upon the following research works:

1. Clifford E. Cummings. (2005). Simulation and Synthesis Techniques for Asynchronous
FIFO Design. SNUG San Jose 2002.
   - This paper helped us to understand the concept and working of an Asynchronous FIFO.
2. Sivaram Durai.(https://github.com/sivaram-07/Async-FIFO)
   - This provided us with a detailed understanding of how to integrate the concepts into programming.
