## How it works

This project will display numbers from 1 to 8 based on which switch is turned on. For example, if switch number 1 is on, it will display the number 1 on the 7-segment display. The dot is connected to the clock to visualize the clock's functionality.

## How to test

Just switch the input buttons.

## External hardware

7-segment display.
