## How it works

The project simply displays different symbols in a 7-segment LED display according to the input binary word.

## How to test

To test the project, one should try different input binary words. The output should only display the letter n (without the dot; outputs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 HIGH and the others LOW) when the input is 0b00010101 (21 in binary).

## External hardware

8 input switches;
7-segment LED display.
