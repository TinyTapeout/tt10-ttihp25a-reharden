## How it works

The project adds two 4-bit numbers and outputs a 5-bit number as the result. 

## How to test

Inputs A0, A1, A2, and A3 are the bits for the first number to be added. A0 is the LSB. Same logic for the B input. The S0, S1, S2 and S3 output are the first 4 bits of the result with the 5th bit named C_OUT since its the carry-out.

## External hardware

I used LED's for the output and switches for the inputs.
