## How it works

By making 1,3,5,7 switches on the dip-switch-8 component high, we display a mirrored 3 ('M' sideways) on the 7-segment display. An LED will light as well when the correct sequence is inputted.

## How to test

Flip the 1,3,5,7 switches to display the mirrored 3 and light the LED

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
